# To create a new EDID:
#  1. Convert the existing EDID to binary using "edid2bin".
#  2. Edit the binary using "AW EDID Editor".
#  3. Save the new EDID in binary format.
#  4. Convert the binary EDID to a hex EDID using "make-edid".
#    - Use the "--yaml" option if required.

# EDID for TC358743 chip.
